1. Based on the average energy, valence, danceability of the songs listened to, the person
    appears to really like songs that are quite intense and has strong, steady beat or danceable
    and sounds more on negative side (e.g. angry, sad, etc.) given the low average valence.
    // avg_energy = 0.65906 (max_energy: 0.909) // avg_valence = 0.484443 (max_valence: 0.931)
    // avg_danceability = 0.71646 (max_danceability: 0.964)

2. The audio aura (if calculated this way) may not be very representative of the listener
    because 1.) some songs may be part of a playlist (not created by user) where the listener
    may not really like all the other songs in the playlist, 2.) sometimes it may be another
    person who has access to the listener's phone (or account) could play some of the songs.
    It might be better to look into what songs the listener actually liked (or hearted?), also
    looking at how many times they listened to it.
